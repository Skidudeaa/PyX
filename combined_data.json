What began as recreational drug use morphed into an addiction that ultimately led to his early death at the tender age of 21. Juice seemingly predicted his own demise on his June 2018  tribute  to  XXXTENTACION  and  Lil Peep , who also died young: On December 8, 2019, Juice WRLD suffered an  accidental overdose at Midway International Airport  in Chicago. He reportedly swallowed multiple pills after law enforcement attempted to intercept his crew upon suspicion of gun and drug possession. The Cook County Medical Examiner confirmed that fatal levels of codeine and oxycodone were present in his body\u2014the latter of which is found in Percocet, or \u201cPerky,\u201d as it is called in the song\u2019s chorus. Before its official release, the song was previewed in March 2018 on Instagram Live. It was then leaked on October 6, 2019, with an extended verse.",
