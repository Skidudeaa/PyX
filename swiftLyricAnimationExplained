This document outlines the design and functionality of a dynamic lyrics display created using SwiftUI. The display is designed to auto-update and auto-scroll in sync with a song's progression, providing a seamless and immersive user experience.

The display consists of a scroll view that presents the lyrics. At any given time, it shows about 6-8 lines – the past, current, and upcoming lyrics, providing a lyrical context. The scroll view auto-scrolls smoothly, keeping pace with the song, making it a set-it-and-forget-it style display.

The current lyric, displayed in a bold font, is the centerpiece of the display, easily identifiable even at a quick glance. Surrounding lyrics are subtly blurred and faded, creating a depth effect that emphasizes the current line. This visual hierarchy draws the user's attention to the current lyric.

The display is not just a static text list but a canvas for a rich, immersive musical experience. The smooth animations and transitions add to the aesthetic appeal, making the lyrics display pleasing to the eye.

In conclusion, this dynamic lyrics display exemplifies the power of SwiftUI in creating complex, dynamic interfaces. It embodies modern UI design principles – simplicity, clarity, and a strong focus on user experience.
