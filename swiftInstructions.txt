Here is an outline of your tasks and responsibilities for this swiftui project:
### Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic lyric display application using SwiftUI. The application needs to read from a JSON file containing song metadata, including song title, artist, album, release date, description, lyrics, annotations,  timestamps, background color to use (bgcolor), and 4 different text colors to use. (i will include a sample of the json data at the end of your instructions so you can incorperate the structure into your swiftui code).  Along with displaying the lyrics and annotations in real-time according to the timestamps synced with a timer that needs to start when the program starts, the app also needs to have a visually appealing design, with custom background and text colors based on the metadata. Additional UI elements like a progress view and a title view are also required for enhanced user experience. There is to be no user interaction. this is a set it and forget it program that will need to be run for each song the user wishes to listen to.

### Components:
1. **JSON Parsing**:
    - The `Song`, `TextColors`, and `LyricsAndAnnotations` structs are to be created to model the JSON data structure.
    - The `loadAndParseJSON()` function is to be implemented to read the `shortSong.json` file and parse it into a `Song` object.
  
2. **Dynamic Lyrics and Annotations Display**:
    - A timer should be used to update the lyrics and annotations dynamically.
    - The `updateLyrics()` function needs to be created to update the `currentLyric` and `currentAnnotation` based on the elapsed time and the timestamps in the JSON.

3. **Custom ProgressView**:
    - A SwiftUI `ProgressView` needs to be designed to show the progress of the song.
    - It updates in real-time and uses one of the text colors from the JSON data (`textColors.textColor3`).

4. **TitleView**:
    - A custom `TitleView` will be created to display the song's title, artist, and album.
    - This view also uses one of the text colors from the JSON data (`textColors.textColor4`).

5. **Styling and Theming**:
    - Uses the `bgColor` from the JSON to set the background color of the entire view.
    - Text colors for lyrics and annotations are also fetched from the `textColors` in the JSON.

### Technologies Used:
- SwiftUI for the UI components.
- Swift's Codable protocol for JSON decoding.
- Timer for real-time updates.

This project should successfully achieve its goals by combining SwiftUI's powerful UI capabilities with Swift's Codable for JSON parsing, and Timer for real-time updates. The result should be a dynamic, data-driven, and visually appealing lyric display application.
