    "description": "\u201cFalling Down\u201d is an alternate version of the song  \u201cSunlight On Your Skin\u201d  by  Lil Peep  and  iLoveMakonnen . This version instead features  XXXTENTACION  and was made after Lil Peep\u2019s death. The song was released by the label,  Columbia Records . Fish Narc,  a  GOTHBOICLIQUE  producer and friend of Peep,  spoke about the song\u2019s potential release  and was totally against it. He went on to say that Peep didn\u2019t support X because of his allegations, and this is just a ploy for Columbia Records to make money off of Peep. Smokeasac  confirmed the song\u2019s release on his  Instagram  saying that \u201ca very special song is dropping by my best friend @lilpeep called \u201cfalling down\u201d featuring @xxxtentacion\u201d Once the new version of the song was confirmed, many of Lil Peep\u2019s close friends, family members, and collaborators were outraged by the songs new feature.  Lil Peep\u2019s mother stated in a comment  replying to a fan that it wasn\u2019t her choice X got put onto the song, it was iLoveMakonnen\u2019s choice. iLoveMakonnen, who was featured on the  original version of the song , said on  his Instagram  that he was \u201chonored to have co-written this song that X was inspired to be a part of, shortly before he died\u201d. XXXTENTACION\u2019s  mother  alluded to the song\u2019s release the day before and even announced that  both her and Peep\u2019s mother teamed up for the release .",
